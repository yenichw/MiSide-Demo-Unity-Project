== Selection Keeper ==

This is an EDITOR ONLY plugin.
It helps you to keep things selected over multiple scene loads.

Usually if you press play in the Editor it will keep your
selection active only on first load. It gets lost once you have
unloaded the scene in play mode, which is annoying.

This plugin restores your selection whenever the last edited
scene(s) are loaded during Play mode.

= Known Issues =

* Objects which are marked as "Do not destroy on load" will not be re-selected in PLAY mode. This is a unity limitation (looking for a workaround).
  

= Settings =

You can find or recreate the settings file (named "SelectionKeeper Settings")
through the main menu (Tools > Selection Keeper > Settings). You can move it out
of the plugins folder too. It's a simple Scriptable Object asset. If you want
you can add it to your gitignore file.

* Enable Plugin
Enables or disables the whole plugin. Turn this off if you suspect
the plugin to cause any weird behaviour (none known at the moment).

* Clear Selection Memory If Empty
Should the selection memory be cleared if everything is deselected (edit mode only)? If disabled then you may have to clear the selection memory by hand (see 'Tools' menu)."

* Ignore selections in play mode
Ignore selection changes during play mode? Turn on if you want the last selection from Edit mode to be restored once you exit the Play mode.
